# What is Machine Learning ?

*ML said to learn from experience with respect to some class of tasks, and a performance measure P, if (the learner's) performance at tasks in the class as measured by P, improves with experience. ~Tom Mitchell 1997*

Where we learn to improve our performance is called **Inductive Learning.**


# Types of Learning

1. **[[Supervised Learning]]**
	-Learning an input and output map
		-Classification: categorical output
		-Regression: continuous output
2. **Unsupervised Learning**
	-Discover patterns in the data
		-Clustering: cohesive grouping
		-Association: frequent co-occurrence
3. **Reinforcement Learning**
	-Learning Control
