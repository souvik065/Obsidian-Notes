**Supervised Learning is like teaching a computer how to do something by showing it examples.**

- In supervised learning, the model learns from labeled training data.

**Step 1:** Data Collection
**Step 2:** Training 
**Step 3:** Testing


## Algorithms

1. Classification goal is to assign input data to predefined categories or classes. Algorithms like **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **Support Vector Machines**, and **Neural Networks** are commonly used for classification tasks.


 2. Regression goal is to predict a numerical value based on input features. Algorithms like **Linear Regression**, **Polynomial Regression**, and various types of **regression trees** are used for regression tasks.
