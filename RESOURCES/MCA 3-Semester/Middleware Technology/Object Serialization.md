**Object Serialization** is the process of converting an objectâ€™s state into a format that can be stored (e.g., in a file or database) or transmitted (e.g., over a network) and later reconstructed. It is essential for persisting objects, transmitting them between systems, or saving them for later use.

### Key Concepts

1. **Serialization**: Converting the object into a byte stream or a standardized format like JSON or XML.
2. **Deserialization**: Reconstructing the object from the serialized format.
3. **Serialized Formats**:
    - **Binary Format**: Compact, suitable for performance-critical applications.
    - **Text Formats**: JSON, XML, YAML, etc., are human-readable and widely supported.

### **Why is Object Serialization Important?**

- **Persistence:** Store objects in files or databases for later use.
- **Data Exchange:** Transmit objects over networks (e.g., between different parts of an application, or between different systems).
- **Deep Copying:** Create an exact copy of an object, including all its nested objects.
