Software Architecture is a Structure or Structure of the system that comprise of Software components.

The externally visible properties of the components and the relationship among them.


A good software architecture will define attributes such as **Performance**, **Quality**, **Scalability**, **Maintainability**, **Manageability** and **Usability** 



## **When to Think About Architecture**

It is imperative to methodically think through software architecture for effective development before writing the very first line of code.

*Software Architecture is **representative** to allow you to see how effective you design is and consider alternatives*

## **Focusing on Components**

Software architecture will focus on components it may be as simple as a single class or as Complicated as a entire middleware component database and more


## **Why is the architecture so important**

Software Architecture provide that facilitates communication amongst all the different stakeholders.

The architecture high lights early design decisions that will have a profound impact on all software engineering work that follows


Architecture constitutes a relatively small, intellectually graspable  model of how the system is structure and how its components work together.
