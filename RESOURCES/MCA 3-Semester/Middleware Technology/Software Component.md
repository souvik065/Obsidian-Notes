A **software component** is a modular, self-contained unit of software that encapsulates a specific functionality or set of functionalities.



### **Key characteristics of software components include:**

1. **Modularity**: They represent a distinct part of the system, performing a specific task.

2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in multiple applications.

3. **Encapsulation**: The internal workings are hidden, and access is provided only through the component's interfaces.

4. **Interoperability**: They can work together with other components, often by adhering to common standards or protocols.

5. **Replaceability**: Components can be replaced by other components without affecting the rest of the system, as long as the interfaces remain consistent.
