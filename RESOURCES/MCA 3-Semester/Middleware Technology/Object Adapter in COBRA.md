In the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), an Object Adapter serves as the bridge between client requests and server object implementations (servants). It acts as a middleware component that handles crucial tasks like:  

- **Generating and interpreting object references:** Creating and understanding unique identifiers for objects.  
    
- **Activating and deactivating servants:** Managing the lifecycle of server objects.  
    
- **Demultiplexing requests:** Directing incoming requests to the appropriate servant.  
    
- **Collaborating with IDL skeletons:** Interacting with code generated from Interface Definition Language (IDL) to invoke operations on servants.
