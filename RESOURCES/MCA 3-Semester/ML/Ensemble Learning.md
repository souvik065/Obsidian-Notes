Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines multiple models to improve predictive performance.

The core idea is that a diverse group of models can outperform any single model. By combining the strengths of multiple models, ensemble methods can often achieve higher accuracy, better generalization, and increased robustness.

Ensemble techniques are a powerful tool in the machine learning arsenal, combining multiple models to achieve better predictive performance than any single model could on its own.

They work by aggregating the predictions of individual models, often called base learners, to obtain a more accurate and robust final prediction.
