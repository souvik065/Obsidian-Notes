- Integration with databases (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) for storing data.

### 3. **Scheduling & Automation**

- Set scraping tasks on schedules (e.g., hourly, daily) for continuous data collection.
- Auto-retry mechanisms in case of failures during scraping.

### 4. **Handling CAPTCHAs & Anti-Scraping**

- Bypass basic CAPTCHA challenges using external services or machine learning-based CAPTCHA solvers.
- Rotate proxies or user agents to avoid detection by anti-scraping mechanisms.

### 5. **Pagination & Infinite Scroll Support**

- Handle multi-page data (pagination) and infinite scroll to extract complete datasets.

### 6. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**

- Alerts or notifications (email, SMS) for task failures or exceptions.

### 8. **Scalability & Parallel Processing**

- Ability to scrape multiple websites or pages in parallel for faster data collection.
- Scalability to handle high volumes of data and concurrent scraping requests.

### 9. **Compliance & Ethical Scraping**

- Ensuring scraping practices align with legal standards, such as data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA).

### 10. **User-Friendly Interface**

- A graphical user interface (GUI) or dashboard to create, monitor, and manage scraping tasks without coding.
- Task scheduling, results visualization, and download options.

### 11. **Authentication Support**

- Ability to scrape websites behind login or authentication walls (e.g., OAuth, cookies).

### 12. **API Integration**
