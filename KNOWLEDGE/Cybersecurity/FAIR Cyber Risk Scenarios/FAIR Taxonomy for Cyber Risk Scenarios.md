This document, "A FAIR Taxonomy for Cyber Risk Scenarios," is about providing a structured and standardized approach to defining cyber risk scenarios


It presents a taxonomy that breaks down a cyber risk scenario into four key components: Threat, Asset, Method, and Effect

The guide offers detailed categories and examples within each of these components to help organizations create well-defined and actionable risk scenarios

# What Is a Cyber Risk Scenario?

The risk scenario is the starting point of an analysis. Think of it as a problem that needs to be analyzed and solved. A risk scenario describes a time-bound, probable loss event and specifies the threat actor and method, the asset at risk, and the effect or consequence that may occur during that time.


# Risk assessment prepares you to answer three questions:

1. **What can go wrong?** (i.e., the scenario conditions causing concern) 
2. **How often will it occur?** (i.e., the loss event frequency of the scenario)
3. **How much do we stand to lose?** (i.e., the loss event magnitude if that scenario occurs)


# Threat

A threat, or threat actor, is anything or anyone capable of acting against an asset in a manner that can result in loss. The term threat is normally applied to all types, including non-human threats such as natural disasters; threat actor generally refers to humans, whereby intent is a consideration. In this guide, we’ll limit the taxonomy to common threat actor types.

## Threat Actor Types

The taxonomy defines the following ten (10) types of threat actors.



# Asset

An asset is anything of meaningful business value that can be affected in a manner that results in loss. This financial loss can be realized immediately, in the short term (in less than one year), or over longer periods of time.

For our purposes, an asset may or may not be reflected on the balance sheet of the business. For example, brand value is rarely reflected on a balance sheet, except after an acquisition, where it is recorded as a component of goodwill. For another example, business data that has been captured and managed by the business is rarely reflected on the books. Even when an asset is recorded in a firm’s asset register, its net book value rarely reflects the true value to the business.


# Method

A method is a specific attack vector used to access or affect the asset. These methods lead to the impact of an attack (Effect) on business operations, data integrity, and financial stability.

Discussions of risk scenarios sometimes leave out method as a defining element. For example, the authors of Measuring and Managing Information Risk: A Fair Approach, leave method out of their tables (e.g., Table 6.1 on page 97) enumerating risk scenarios. However, cyber risk scenarios involving different methods are often quite different from one another in terms of the level of risk and the controls necessary to reduce their risk, so we’ve included method as a defining element in our taxonomy.


# Loss Categories

The effects in our taxonomy come from the FAIR Materiality Assessment Model (FAIR-MAM), which describes ten (10) loss categories. These categories represent both primary and secondary losses. Primary losses occur directly as a result of the loss event and are more certain to materialize when a loss event occurs. Secondary losses occur indirectly from a loss event, typically due to actions or reactions by secondary stakeholders who have been harmed from or are motivated by an event. The loss effect or effects you choose for a cyber risk scenario can be based on either primary or secondary losses, or a combination of both.
