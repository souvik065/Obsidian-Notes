	- You should only collect personal data for specified explicit and legitimate purposes and not process it in a manner that's incompatible with those purposes,  this is the purpose limitation principle.
	- the key takeaway here when you're creating your privacy notices for that transparency principle make sure you cover the purposes for which you're processing a data it's not easy to suddenly start processing for a new purpose if you haven't identified it up front there are some exceptions for research and statistics which aren't seen as incompatible and this is one area the UK is looking at in its new August 2021 onwards review and we'll see how that goes now number three data minimization personal data that you process must be adequate and relevant and limited to what's necessary in relation to the purposes for what you're processing data minimization means you don't collect more personal data than is necessary for your stated purpose it's actually always been the case as I said before but gdpr's finds an increased awareness means it's clear you've got to be focused on only collecting what's necessary and a good benefit if you're sending us to other team members having less personal data means there's less to

protect against breach less risk and
less to search for a data subject request okay accuracy personal data you
1. **Data Minimization - Collect only the necessary data.**
2. **Accuracy - Ensure stored data is correct and up to date.**

## **Lawfulness, fairness & transparency** - **Users must know how their data is collected and used.**

- Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly in a transparent manner  in relation to the Data subject.

- **Lawful** includes identifying a legal basis for your process and their have been fine for not identifying one, and for identifying the wrong one, like consent legitimate interest etc. 

- **Transparent** includes providing all the information that GPDR says you've got to give individual data subjects about what you're doing  with their personal data.

- **Fairness** is subjective, but it plays into the reasonable expectations of the individual. As the **UK ICO states**, this means you must not process the data in a way that's **unduly detrimental**, **unexpected** or **misleading** to the individual


## **Purpose Limitation** - **Data should be collected for a specific purpose and not used beyond that.. **
