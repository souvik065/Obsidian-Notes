Here are some fundamental cybersecurity principles you should know about:

1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. This involves protecting data from unauthorized access and disclosure.
    
2. **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data. This means protecting data from being altered or tampered with by unauthorized individuals.
    
3. **Availability**: Ensuring that information and resources are available to authorized users when needed. This involves protecting systems from disruptions like denial-of-service attacks.
    
4. **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users, systems, or entities before granting access to resources. This is often done through passwords, biometrics, or multi-factor authentication.
    
5. **Authorization**: Granting permissions to users or systems to access specific resources based on their roles or requirements.
