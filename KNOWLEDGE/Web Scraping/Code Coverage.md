Code coverage is a software testing metric used to measure how much of the source code of a program is executed during testing. 

It helps developers understand how thoroughly their code is being tested by indicating the percentage of code that is covered by automated tests, such as unit tests.



## **Key Points of Code Coverage:**

1. **Measurement:** Code coverage is usually expressed as a percentage, with 100% meaning that all the code paths have been tested. For example, if a project has 10 functions and 9 of them are executed during testing, the code coverage would be 90%.

2. **Types of Code Coverage:**
    
    - **Function Coverage:** Measures whether each function in the program has been called.
    - **Statement Coverage:** Measures whether each statement in the code has been executed.
    - **Branch Coverage:** Measures whether each possible branch (e.g., if-else conditions) has been executed.
    - **Condition Coverage:** Measures whether each boolean sub-expression has been evaluated to both true and false.

1. **Tools:** Various tools are available for measuring code coverage, depending on the programming language and development environment. Some popular tools include:
    - **JaCoCo** for Java
    - **Coverage.py** for Python
    - **Istanbul** for JavaScript

1. **Purpose:** The main goal of code coverage is to identify untested parts of the codebase, allowing developers to write additional tests to improve coverage and potentially catch more bugs.

5. **Limitations:** While high code coverage is generally desirable, it doesn't guarantee the quality of the tests or the absence of bugs. Code coverage should be used in conjunction with other testing practices.
