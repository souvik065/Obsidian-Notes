An HTTP interceptor is a piece of code that allows you to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests and responses in a web application or an API. 

They are commonly used in web frameworks or libraries, especially in client-side applications, to handle tasks like authentication, logging, error handling, or modifying requests before they are sent to the server and responses before they are processed by the application.


### **Common Use Cases for HTTP Interceptors:**

1. **Authentication**: Automatically attach authentication tokens (like JWT) to outgoing requests.
2. **Error Handling**: Capture error responses and handle them globally, such as redirecting to a login page if the server returns a 401 Unauthorized error.
3. **Logging**: Log details of requests and responses for debugging or monitoring.
4. **Modifying Requests**: Add headers, change the request URL, or modify request data before the request is sent.
5. **Caching**: Cache responses or check the cache before sending a request to the server.

### **Where HTTP Interceptors are Used:**

- **Client-Side**:
	- In frameworks like Angular, React (with Axios or Fetch), or Vue.js, interceptors are used to handle requests and responses within the browser.
	
- **Server-Side**: 
	- In backend frameworks like Express.js or Django, middleware can function as interceptors, allowing the server to process requests before routing them to the intended handler.
