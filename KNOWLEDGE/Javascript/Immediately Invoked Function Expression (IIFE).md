An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a function expression that is executed immediately after its creation.
It’s a common pattern in JavaScript to create a new scope and avoid variable collisions with the global scope.


Here’s a breakdown of the syntax:

1. **Function Expression**: `(function() { ... })` - This defines a function but doesn’t call it yet.
2. **Immediately Invoked**: `()` - This part immediately executes the function defined in the previous step.
