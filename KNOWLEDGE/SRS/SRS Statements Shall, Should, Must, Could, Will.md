In the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**, the choice between "shall," "must," "should," "could," and "will" depends on the level of necessity or importance attached to each requirement. Here’s a breakdown of how to use each term:

### 1. **Shall**

- **Purpose**: Mandatory requirements.
- **Usage**: Describes what the system **must** do or what behavior is essential to its functionality.
- **Example**:
    - The system **shall** allow users to log in using a username and password.
    - The system **shall** store data in a NoSQL database.

### 2. **Must**

- **Purpose**: Used for requirements that are **absolutely necessary** (stronger than "shall" but often interchangeable in formal SRS documents).
- **Usage**: Often used to express legal or critical requirements.
- **Example**:
    - The system **must** comply with GDPR data protection regulations.
    - The system **must** encrypt all user data during transmission.

### 3. **Should**

- **Purpose**: Important but **not mandatory** requirements. These are highly desirable, but the system can still function if not implemented.
- **Usage**: Describes recommendations or best practices.
- **Example**:
    - The system **should** allow users to reset their password via email.
    - The system **should** be able to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.

### 4. **Could**

- **Purpose**: Optional requirements. These are nice-to-have features that can be implemented if time and resources permit.
- **Usage**: Describes features that are not critical to the system’s core functionality.
- **Example**:
    - The system **could** include an interactive data visualization dashboard.
    - The system **could** offer support for multiple languages.

### 5. **Will**

- **Purpose**: Describes the future behavior of the system or development steps.
- **Usage**: Typically used in introductory or planning sections, not for strict requirements.
- **Example**:
    - The development team **will** implement a proxy management feature in phase two of the project.
    - The system **will** support additional data formats in future releases
