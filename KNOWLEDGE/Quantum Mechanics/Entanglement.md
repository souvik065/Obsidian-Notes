Entanglement is a key phenomenon in quantum computing where two or more qubits become interconnected such that the state of one qubit is dependent on the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are. This means that measuring one qubit instantly determines the state of the other.

### Key Points:
1. *Correlation*: Entangled qubits share a single quantum state, and their properties are linked in a way that cannot be explained by classical physics.
2. *Non-Locality*: Changes to one qubit's state affect the other instantaneously, even over large distances.
3. *Applications*:
   - *Quantum Teleportation*: Transferring quantum information between distant locations.
   - *Quantum Cryptography*: Ensuring secure communication by detecting eavesdropping.
   - *Superdense Coding*: Sending more information using fewer qubits.
4. *EPR Paradox*: Proposed by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, it highlights the "spooky action at a distance" nature of entanglement.

Entanglement is essential for the power of quantum computing, enabling faster computations and secure communication systems.
