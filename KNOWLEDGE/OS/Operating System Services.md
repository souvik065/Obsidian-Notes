Operating system (OS) services provide essential functionalities that help users, applications, and hardware communicate efficiently. These services can be broadly categorized as follows:

### 1. **Process Management**

- The OS manages processes by creating, scheduling, and terminating them.
- It handles **multitasking, multiprocessing, and synchronization**.
- Example: Windows Task Manager allows users to monitor and control processes.

### 2. **Memory Management**

- Allocates and deallocates memory dynamically for programs.
- Manages **virtual memory, paging, and segmentation**.
- Example: Swapping inactive processes to disk when RAM is full.

### 3. **File System Management**

- Handles file creation, deletion, reading, writing, and permissions.
- Provides **directory structures, access control, and file organization**.
- Example: NTFS and FAT32 are common file systems in Windows.

### 4. **Device Management**

- Controls access to hardware devices (printers, disks, USB).
- Uses **device drivers and I/O buffering** for smooth communication.
- Example: Plug-and-play functionality in Windows and Linux.

### 5. **Security and Access Control**

- Ensures data privacy using **authentication, encryption, and firewalls**.
- Implements **user privileges and access control lists (ACLs)**.
- Example: Windows UAC (User Account Control) restricts administrative actions.

### 6. **User Interface (UI)**

- Provides **Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Command Line Interface (CLI)**.
- Example: Windows Explorer (GUI), Linux Terminal (CLI).

### 7. **Networking Services**

- Manages communication between computers over networks.
- Implements **protocols like TCP/IP, FTP, SSH, and HTTP**.
- Example: Internet access, file sharing, remote desktop connections.

### 8. **Error Handling and Logging**

- Detects and reports system errors or crashes.
- Maintains **log files and system reports**.
- Example: Windows Event Viewer logs system issues.

### 9. **Program Execution**

- Loads and runs applications smoothly.
- Handles **process creation, execution, and termination**.
- Example: Running a web browser or text editor.

### 10. **Interprocess Communication (IPC)**

- Allows processes to communicate via **message passing or shared memory**.
- Example: Pipes and sockets used in Linux for process interaction.

### 11. **Resource Allocation**

- Distributes CPU time, memory, and I/O devices among processes.
- Uses **schedulers and resource allocation algorithms**.
- Example: CPU scheduling using Round Robin or Priority Scheduling.
