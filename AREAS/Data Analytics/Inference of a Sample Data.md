Inference of data can refer to a few different things, including: 

- **Statistical inference:** The process of drawing conclusions about a population based on data that may have random variation. This is also known as inferential statistics. Some steps for making statistical inferences include: 
    
    - Planning and designing the study 
        
    - Collecting data 
        
    - Analyzing the data 
        
    - Interpreting the results 
        
    - Presenting the results

- **Inference in database security:** A method of using logical or statistical analysis to deduce sensitive information from non-sensitive data. For example, an attacker who has access to a database with both sensitive and non-sensitive data could carry out an inference attack. 


### **Note :-**
Inference data is **the input feature values that are the input to a trained model that outputs a prediction**.
