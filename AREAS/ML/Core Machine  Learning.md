# What is Learning ?

### Model get Trained!

`Training data ---> Algorithm ---> Trained Algo`

**Example :**
Rats Learning to avoid poisonous Belts
`Rate ---> Novel Look oh smell ---> Ill effect on rat ---> Rats Will not eat it`

It will learn through the history of past mistakes



# Learning by Memorization Approach

`Spam ---> Machine will memorize spam email ---> Spam/Ham by searching it in memory`

## Problem with this Approach
The problem doesn't have the ability to label any of the unseen emails  

**So, We need to Generalize it's called as Inductive Inference.(Ability to label unseen emails!)**


**Note :-**
*But Inductive Inference might lead us to false predictions, let's see how*
*Our model may end up learning a meaningless learning Conclusions.(we must give well defined crisp principles and those principles are called **The Theory of ML**) *
